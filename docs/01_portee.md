# Scope (CORE SCOPE)

## What EMBER will do
- Ingest application and service errors.
- Deterministic grouping of events into “issues”.
- Human‑readable summaries + clean stacktraces.
- Release markers and regression detection.
- Minimal notifications (new critical issue, regression).

## What EMBER will not do
- APM, tracing, logs, metrics, full observability.
- BI, KPIs, business dashboards.
- Heavy enterprise features (fine‑grained RBAC, audits, compliance).
- Mandatory LLM or forced cloud.

Goal: stay useful and simple, not exhaustive.
