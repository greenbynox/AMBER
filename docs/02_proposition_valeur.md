# Value proposition

- Less noise: smart grouping + regression detection.
- Clearer: readable explanations, not a sea of graphs.
- Simple self‑hosted: Postgres + 2 services.
- Controlled cost: you pay for your infra, not per error volume.
- Minimal SDK: quick integration, no heavy agent.

Why switch: reduce useless alerts and understand the root cause faster.
